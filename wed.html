<h1>BASIC OF HTML</h1>
<!--h1 is used for heading -->
<!--p is used for paragraph-->
<p>HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, 
was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 to help 
researchers share documents online using the World Wide Web.
 The first version of HTML was very simple and had only a few basic tags.
 In 1995, HTML 2.0 was introduced by the IETF,
 adding more structure like forms and tables. Later, HTML 3.2 was
 released in 1997 by the W3C, which supported scripting and applets.
 In 1999, HTML 4.01 became popular, adding features like CSS support,
 improved forms, and better web page accessibility. Then came XHTML in 2000,
 which followed stricter XML rules and required cleaner code. The most modern
 version, HTML5, started development in 2008 and is still used today. 
 It introduced powerful new features like the
 tags, along with support for offline apps, mobile compatibility, and better
 form controls, making it ideal for modern web development.<p>
